# Business Case Study: Which Price Should They Charge
In this Jupyter Notebook, I conduct hypothesis testing to help a hypothetical business owner, Brian, make a profitable decision.

The dataset is from a machine learning course that I'm currently enrolled in. I really enjoyed this project; it was during a statistics section.

I had some fun with this project by including additional visuals, as the original outline focused on hypothesis testing.

With that said, let's look at Brian's problem. Brian wants to know the best price for a new product. How can Brian determine the best decision from his sample data?
